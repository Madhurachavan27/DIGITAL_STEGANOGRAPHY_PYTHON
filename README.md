# DIGITAL_STEGANOGRAPHY_PYTHON
Digital steganography encompasses the covert embedding of data within images, audio files, and videos, enabling hidden communication or information concealment within multimedia content.

For image steganography, you can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) or its fork, Pillow, which is more actively maintained. You can install Pillow using pip:

pip install Pillow
