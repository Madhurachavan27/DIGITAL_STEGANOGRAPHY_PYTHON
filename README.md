# DIGITAL_STEGANOGRAPHY_PYTHON
Digital steganography encompasses the covert embedding of data within images, audio files, videos, and text files enabling hidden communication or information concealment within multimedia content.

For Digital steganography, you can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) or its fork, Pillow, which is more actively maintained. You can install Pillow using pip:

pip install Pillow

pip install pydub

pip install opencv-python-headless
